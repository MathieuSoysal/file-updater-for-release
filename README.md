# Files updater for release
[![Test Actions](https://github.com/MathieuSoysal/file-updater-for-release/actions/workflows/test-action-final.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MathieuSoysal/file-updater-for-release/actions/workflows/test-action-final.yml)*(Tested on Ubuntu, Macos, Windows)*


Update automatically the old version in your readme (or other files) with your new tag version.

## Requirements
- You need to give permission to your GitHub Actions to create a pull request in your GitHub repo settings *(Settings -> Actions -> General)*.   

OR


- Instead of use `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` use a GitHub [Personnal Acces Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) like : `${{ secrets.PAT }}`.

## Usage

### With pull request

The workflow, usually declared in `.github/workflows/post-release.yml`, looks like:

<details open>

<summary>.github/workflows/post-release.yml</summary>

```YAML
name: Update files

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Update files
        uses: MathieuSoysal/file-updater-for-release@v1.0.1
        with:
          files: README.md # List of files to update
          prefix: "file-updater-for-release@" # Prefix before the version, default is: ""

      - name: Create Pull Request
        uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # You need to create your own token with pull request rights
          commit-message: update readme
          title: Update readme
          body: Update readme to reflect release changes
          branch: update-readme
